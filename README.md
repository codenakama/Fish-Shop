This is a rebuild in ReactJs of a previous exercise I had done in vanilla JS. 

The app simulates a fish shop where the owner is trying to help you buy the right fish for your tank. 
Because some fish can't live with others, the seller will help you with that too - this is provided by an API (here I am simulating this API) that might go wrong sometimes, and you are supposed to handle that too graciously - for example the shop might fload.

This app is using:
- React
- Redux
- React router

##Development

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

##Build

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```
